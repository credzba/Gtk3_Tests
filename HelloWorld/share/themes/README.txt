After much frustration, I figured out that Windows gtk3 wants themes in
(maybe other, but at least) the {executable directory}/share/themes/...
So that I dont forget I am adding this comment.

The built in Themes (on Windows) are : HighContrast, HighContrastInverted, win32, and Adwaita

A new theme can be added to the themes directory specified above by setting the environment variable GTK_THEME.
